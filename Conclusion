IT1025 was a great experience that allowed me to get my feet wet in many aspects of IT. It has opened my eyes and given me purpose in pursuing my degree and given me focus at the same time. I've made the decision that while persuing my degree I will also get certifications and python and COMPTIA. I will also persue an entry level or internship position with EATON seeing as they seem to have a great hands on program in place for information security professionals.
